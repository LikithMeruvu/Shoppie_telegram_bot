## Flipkart Product Scraper and Telegram Bot

### Overview

This repository contains three Python scripts that work together to scrape product details from the Flipkart website and send the information to a Telegram channel using a Telegram bot. Below is a brief description of each script:

1. **`scraping_data.py`:**

   - This script is responsible for scraping product details from the Flipkart website.
   - It uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the pages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract relevant product information.
   - The products are categorized, and the script goes through each category and paginates through the product listing pages using multithreading for faster processing.
   - The scraped data is saved to a `.json` file for further use.

2. **`tele_bot_sendmsg.py`:**

   - This script sets up an asynchronous Telegram bot using the `aiogram` library.
   - You need to provide your Telegram bot token and the channel ID or group ID where you want to post the product details.
   - The script reads the previously scraped data from the `.json` file (generated by `scraping_data.py`) and sends the product details along with images to the specified Telegram channel or group.

3. **`shoppie_bot.py`:**

   - This script is a combination of both `scraping_data.py` and `tele_bot_sendmsg.py`.
   - It performs both tasks in one program, first scraping product details from Flipkart and then sending the details to a Telegram channel using the Telegram bot.
   - If want your own bot create a new bot using botFather in telegram and get your bot token.

### How to Use

1. **Requirements:**

   - Python 3.x
   - Install the required libraries using `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pyshorteners aiogram aiohttp pandas`.

2. **Telegram Bot Setup:**

   - Before using `tele_bot_sendmsg.py` or `shoppie_bot.py`, create a Telegram bot and obtain the bot token.
   - Additionally, get the Telegram channel ID or group ID where you want to post the product details.

3. **Scraping Data (Optional):**

   - If you only want to scrape data and save it to a `.json` file, run `scraping_data.py` by executing `python scraping_data.py` in the terminal.
   - The script will start scraping product details from Flipkart and save the data to a `.json` file.

4. **Sending Data to Telegram Channel (Optional):**

   - If you already have the scraped data saved in a `.json` file and want to send it to a Telegram channel, edit `tele_bot_sendmsg.py` to set your bot token and channel ID.
   - Then, run `tele_bot_sendmsg.py` by executing `python tele_bot_sendmsg.py` in the terminal.
   - The script will read the previously scraped data from the `.json` file and send the product details along with images to the specified Telegram channel.

5. **Combining Scraping and Sending (Shoppie Bot):**

   - `shoppie_bot.py` is a combination of both scraping and sending tasks.
   - Before using `shoppie_bot.py`, make sure you have set your bot token and channel ID as mentioned in the previous steps.
   - Run `shoppie_bot.py` by executing `python shoppie_bot.py` in the terminal.
   - The script will scrape product details from Flipkart and immediately send them to the specified Telegram channel using the Telegram bot.

### Note

- The scraping functionality of `scraping_data.py` is specific to the structure of the Flipkart website and may be subject to change if the website's structure is modified.
- Use web scraping responsibly and adhere to the website's terms of service.
- Ensure you have proper authorization before scraping data from any website.
